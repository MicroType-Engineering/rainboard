Rainboard Lightning Specification:






Include all v0.4 features and:



Architectural changes:


Use low latency multiplexing:

61 keys + 12 metabuttons

73 inputs 

2 analog inputs (maybe expand to 3?)

how many input pins are required for this approach?

please link to an explainer on this technique.




Programmer mode:

Press and hold 4 buttons to toggle programmer mode.












Should still work if the LEDs are not populated




1) Integrate Arduino Mega onto PCB

5) All SMT components populated by JLCPCB

2) Power supply capable of powering 61 LEDS and Arduino, efficiently 

4) 61 LEDS and bypass caps

3) engage programmer mode with meta buttons

6) add 220 ohm Resistor to each button positive (for static discharge protection)?

7) Redesign back panel for better aesthetic design.



Stretch goals:

7) sustain pedal in

8) CV out
