Rainboard Lightning Spec





* Two versions of product will use same PCB: 

  Lightning:
    61 performance buttons (the buttons on top of unit)
    61 RGB LEDs (one LED under each button)
    12 meta-buttons (buttons on sides)
    2 softpots 
    2 MIDI DINs
    DC power input
    Sustain pedal in  
    Foot controller in
    Control Voltage out

  Thunder:
    61 main keys (RGB lEDs left unpopulated)
    USB only




Take existing PCB and improve:

* Integrate Arduino Mega onto PCB

* Implement input multiplexing (maybe remove IO expander if unecessary)

* Power supply capable of powering 61 LEDS and Arduino, efficiently 

* When unit is powered with USB only, should still function, but without lights.

* 61 LEDS and bypass caps

* engage programmer mode with meta buttons (or other solutio)

* add 220 ohm Resistor to each button positive (for static discharge protectio)?

* Redesign back panel for better aesthetic design.
