Rainboard Lightning Spec




Include all v0.4 features and:

* Integrate Arduino Mega onto PCB

* Implement input multiplexing (maybe remove IO expander if unecessar)


* Power supply capable of powering 61 LEDS and Arduino, efficiently 

* When unit is powered with USB only, should still function, but without lights.

* 61 LEDS and bypass caps

* engage programmer mode with meta buttons (or other solutio*

* add 220 ohm Resistor to each button positive (for static discharge protectio)?

* Redesign back panel for better aesthetic design.

* Two versions of product will use PCB: 

  Lightning:
    61 RGB LEDSs
    12 meta-buttons
    2 potentiometers 
    Midi-DINs
    DC power input
    sustain pedal in  
    control-voltage-out

  Thunder:
    61 main keys (RGB lEDs left unpopulated)
    USB only.
