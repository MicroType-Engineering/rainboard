goal of v0.4 PCB is to validate component selection.







Include all v0.3 features and:

1) Integrate Arduino Mega onto PCB

5) All SMT components populated by JLCPCB

2) Power supply capable of powering 61 LEDS and Arduino, efficiently 

4) 61 LEDS and bypass caps

3) engage programmer mode with meta buttons

6) add 220 ohm Resistor to each button positive (for static discharge protection)?

7) Redesign back panel for better aesthetic design.



Stretch goals:

7) sustain pedal in

8) CV out
